# Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO)

The Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO) is a prominent non-profit organization that aligns with the objectives of our project, "Transformative Workforce Academy". CEO's mission is to provide immediate, effective, and comprehensive employment services to individuals returning from incarceration. Its programs primarily serve justice-involved individuals in urban areas across the United States, focusing on the needs of these people who often face barriers in their attempts to reenter the job market.

The desired outcome for the CEO's program is two-fold: reducing recidivism by helping justice-involved individuals gain stable employment and creating a safer, more productive society by fostering their successful reintegration. Their methodology hinges on a four-phase approach: life skills education, short-term paid transitional employment, full-time job placement, and post-placement services. The organization collects data regularly to evaluate its progress. According to the data available, a study by MDRC reported that CEO significantly reduces recidivism, with effects persisting three years post-program participation.

CEO services communities that bear the brunt of mass incarceration and high unemployment rates, addressing the critical need for employment services tailored to justice-involved individuals. The program meets the quality criteria by incorporating immediate paid employment and support services, allowing participants to stabilize their lives, work toward financial independence, and reduce the likelihood of recidivism. To further ensure the quality and impact of their programs, CEO engages in robust data collection and evaluation processes, which guides continuous program improvement and maintains transparency with its stakeholders. They work closely with employers who offer 'second chance' opportunities, thus forging a supportive network for the participants that extends beyond the organization's immediate scope.
