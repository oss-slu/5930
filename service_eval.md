Drawing from the principles outlined in "The Servant as Leader" by Robert K. Greenleaf:

1. The Primacy of Service: An individual engaged with the TEAMMATES group as a servant leader would prioritize serving the needs of the student and teacher communities. The focus would be primarily on providing a evaluation and peer feedback mechanism that meets the desired outcomes of being able to provide simplicity, flexibility, and power in feedback.

2. Listening: As an individual engaging with the TEAMMATES group as a servant leader, one would listen actively to the input and feedback from the student and teacher communities, understand their needs, perspectives, and challenges. This is generally achieved via GitHub repository discussions, open channels communication, and seeking feedback and reviews from users.

3. Empathy and Awareness: A servant leader in this context would empathize with the users of the TEAMMATES project, understanding the importance of constructive feedback and its impact on personal and professional growth. They would prioritize creating an environment where users feel heard, valued, and supported. A servant leader would engage with the TEAMMATES community to have a deep understanding of the project's goals, the needs of the users.

4. Conceptualization: An individual engaging with the TEAMMATES group as a servant leader would have a long-term perspective for the TEAMMATES project and its impact on the student and teacher communities. They would work towards developing a clear vision and effectively communicate it to the group, inspiring others to contribute to the project's goals.

5. Stewardship and Building Community: An individual engaging with the TEAMMATES group as a servant leader would prioritize building a sense of community within the TEAMMATES project. They would help develop a culture of accountability, collaboration, trust, and mutual respect among contributors, creating an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are valued, reviewd and approved. The servant leader would act responsibly, ensuring the project's sustainability, and effectively managing resources and contributions.

By applying these servant leadership principles, an individual engaged with the TEAMMATES open-source project could contribute to its success, ensure the needs of the teacher and student communities are met, and foster a collaborative and supportive environment for all involved.
