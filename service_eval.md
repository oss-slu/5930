For my research work, I have choosen ‘RED CROSS’ an International humanitarian organization that provides emergency aid, disaster relief, and help to persons and communities in need. They provide blood donations, disaster relief, health and safety training, and assistance to military families.
I have considered the following questions while researching about RED CROSS Organization.
	Desired outcomes for the program?

The Red Cross humanitarian organization's desired outcomes include providing emergency assistance and relief to individuals and communities affected by disasters, saving lives through blood donations, providing community health and safety training, and supporting military families during times of crisis. They seek to reduce suffering and improve the overall well-being of those in need.

	Evidences about whether they are succeeding in achieving their desired outcomes?

The Organization has a long history of responding to catastrophes and disasters around the world, offering immediate support and relief to impacted populations. They have a proven track record of mobilizing volunteers, money, and experience to effectively respond to disasters. Furthermore, the group has gathered data and impact reports demonstrating the number of lives saved through blood donations, the number of people taught in life-saving techniques, and the assistance provided to military families during deployments or emergencies.

	What community or communities are being served?

The Red Cross Organization serves a diverse spectrum of communities worldwide. They respond to local, national, and international calamities, providing help to afflicted communities wherever they are. In addition, they collaborate closely with hospitals, healthcare facilities, and blood banks to provide a steady supply of blood and blood products for people in need. Additionally, they serve military families by providing services and resources to assist them through deployments and emergencies.

	What is the need that is being met?

The Red Cross responds to a variety of needs, including disaster response and assistance, blood donations, health and safety training, and military family support. They offer shelter, food, and medical help to populations afflicted by natural disasters, conflicts, or other calamities. The organization is critical in ensuring a sufficient blood supply for transfusions and other medical procedures. They also provide health and safety training programs, which empower individuals and communities with life-saving skills and information. Finally, the Red Cross assists military families by offering programs that meet their special concerns and ensure their well-being during deployment or crisis situations.

	How does the program address quality criteria?

For starters, they've developed standardized protocols and rules for crisis response, blood donation procedures, and health and safety training. These protocols ensure that their operations are consistent, safe, and effective. Second, the organization aggressively interacts with local communities, governments, and partner groups to ensure that its humanitarian activities are coordinated and thorough. They engage in continual program review and improvement, utilizing data and feedback to better their services. Furthermore, the Red Cross maintains a large network of qualified volunteers who go through rigorous training to uphold quality standards and respond to situations effectively.

Servant as a Leader Evaluation

The Red Cross is primarily concerned with helping others. Individuals who volunteer with the organization have the ability to directly aid those in need, whether through disaster relief, blood donation, or military family support. Servant leaders can actively participate in these activities, devoting their time and abilities to meeting the community's needs. Servant leaders promote empathy and listening in order to comprehend others' worries and needs. Individuals can develop empathy by sincerely listening to the stories and experiences of catastrophe victims, blood recipients, or military families when interacting with the Red Cross. Servant leaders may better personalize their support and provide the required assistance if they understand their issues. Servant leaders are dedicated to personal development and learning. Individuals can consistently improve their skills and expertise within the Red Cross by participating in training programs, workshops, and seminars. Servant leaders can provide more effective and efficient aid by being knowledgeable on best practices in disaster response, blood safety, and military support.
