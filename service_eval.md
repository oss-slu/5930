The program responds to this need by organizing clean-up campaigns and tree-planting activities, disseminating educational materials, promoting legislative reforms, and giving practical ways for people and companies to lessen their ecological imprint. EcoWarriors excels in several areas when it comes to quality standards. They have a group of knowledgeable, committed volunteers who are enthusiastic about environmental issues. The program makes use of educational tools and methods supported by research to effectively disseminate knowledge and motivate behavior change.
