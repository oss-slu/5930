# Project TWA Careers and Candidates Matching

## Client Profile

The Transformative Workforce Academy (TWA) is an initiative at Saint Louis University aimed at supporting individuals at risk of incarceration to lead productive lives without returning to prison. SLU's comprehensive approach includes prevention, in-prison, and reentry services. TWA specifically focuses on helping individuals leaving prison to find and maintain meaningful employment.

TWA started its efforts in 2018 by organizing the Second Chance Job Fair in partnership with federal and state probation and parole offices. The fair aimed to connect job seekers with employers who consider candidates holistically, beyond their criminal records. Building on the success of these job fairs, TWA now aims to provide year-round support to jobseekers and employers through the Second Chance Job Portal. The Second Chance Job Portal will offer resources and assistance for jobseekers seeking second-chance employment, as well as support for employers interested in hiring and retaining this often overlooked segment of the workforce. The goal is to facilitate successful employment opportunities and help address the root causes of crime by providing ongoing support and resources to those seeking a second chance.

 # Servant as a Leader
 In "The Servant as Leader," a seminal essay by Robert K. Greenleaf, servant leadership is described as a philosophy in which the primary focus of a leader is to serve others and enable their growth. Applying the principles of servant leadership to engaging with a community service group like the Transgender Law Center can enhance one's ability to contribute effectively and positively. Here's an amended evaluation highlighting how an individual can engage with the Transgender Law Center as a servant leader:

1. Listening and empathy: A servant leader understands the importance of active listening and empathy. When engaging with the Transgender Law Center, take the time to listen to the experiences and needs of transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. Seek to understand their challenges, perspectives, and aspirations without judgment or assumptions. This empathetic approach allows you to better serve the community's needs and concerns.

2. Commitment to equity and inclusion: A servant leader recognizes and respects the diversity within the community they serve. In engaging with the Transgender Law Center, it is important to promote equity and inclusion for all transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. Acknowledge and value the intersecting identities and experiences that shape their lives. Advocate for policies and practices that address systemic inequalities and discrimination.

3. Collaboration and partnership: A servant leader understands the value of collaboration and building partnerships. When engaging with the Transgender Law Center, seek opportunities to collaborate with other individuals, organizations, and stakeholders who share the mission of advancing transgender rights. Foster relationships based on trust, mutual respect, and shared goals to amplify the collective impact of the community service group.

4. Empowerment and support: A servant leader empowers others and supports their personal growth. Engaging with the Transgender Law Center involves providing support to transgender and gender nonconforming individuals in their pursuit of justice, equality, and well-being. Offer your skills, resources, and time to assist the organization in their initiatives. Provide mentorship, guidance, and encouragement to individuals within the community, helping them develop their leadership potential.

5. Advocacy and systemic change: A servant leader is committed to making a positive difference beyond immediate service. Engaging with the Transgender Law Center includes advocating for systemic change to dismantle discriminatory policies and practices. Use your voice and influence to raise awareness about transgender issues, promote understanding, and drive policy reforms that protect the rights and well-being of the community.

By embodying these principles of servant leadership, individuals can engage with the Transgender Law Center in a manner that aligns with their mission and fosters positive change. It is essential to remember that servant leadership is an ongoing process that requires continuous self-reflection, learning, and adaptation to effectively serve the needs of the community.
