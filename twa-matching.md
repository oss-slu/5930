# Project TWA Careers and Candidates Matching

## Client Profile

The Transformative Workforce Academy (TWA) is an initiative at Saint Louis University aimed at supporting individuals at risk of incarceration to lead productive lives without returning to prison. SLU's comprehensive approach includes prevention, in-prison, and reentry services. TWA specifically focuses on helping individuals leaving prison to find and maintain meaningful employment.

TWA started its efforts in 2018 by organizing the Second Chance Job Fair in partnership with federal and state probation and parole offices. The fair aimed to connect job seekers with employers who consider candidates holistically, beyond their criminal records. Building on the success of these job fairs, TWA now aims to provide year-round support to jobseekers and employers through the Second Chance Job Portal. The Second Chance Job Portal will offer resources and assistance for jobseekers seeking second-chance employment, as well as support for employers interested in hiring and retaining this often overlooked segment of the workforce. The goal is to facilitate successful employment opportunities and help address the root causes of crime by providing ongoing support and resources to those seeking a second chance.

#Servant as Leader

The concept of "Servant Leadership," as detailed in Robert K. Greenleaf's book, "The Servant as Leader," centers around the idea that the most effective leaders are those who prioritize the needs of their team and help people develop and perform as highly as possible. Servant-leaders put the needs of others first and help people develop and perform to their highest potential.

To engage with the Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO) as a servant leader, an individual can consider the following:

Listening: A servant leader could engage with CEO by actively listening to the needs, concerns, and suggestions of justice-involved individuals in the program, as well as those of the second chance employers. This can help in better understanding the unique challenges both parties face and developing solutions tailored to their needs.

Empathy: A servant leader within CEO can show empathy towards justice-involved individuals who are often marginalized and misunderstood. This empathy could translate to programs that don't just see employment as the end goal, but that also take into account the emotional well-being of the individuals, recognizing the trauma and stigma they may be facing.

Awareness: A servant leader must have a strong awareness of the broader social, economic, and political context of mass incarceration and high unemployment rates among justice-involved individuals. This awareness will inform strategies that are responsive and relevant to the needs of the people they are serving.

Stewardship: A servant leader in the CEO would see themselves as stewards of the organization's mission, assuming responsibility for the well-being of the individuals in the program and the integrity of the mission. This can translate to actively seeking funds, resources, and partnerships that can enhance the reach and impact of the CEO's programs.

Commitment to Growth of People: A servant leader could display commitment to the growth of people within CEO by investing in programs that provide skills training and professional development opportunities for justice-involved individuals, ensuring they are not just employed, but are also growing professionally and personally.

By employing these principles, a servant leader can truly align with the CEO's mission to support justice-involved individuals and foster their successful reintegration into society through gainful employment.
