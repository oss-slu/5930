# Project Youth Group Drone Control Mobile App

## Client Profile

A free program in St. Louis teaches teenagers from remote areas how to fly drones professionally. The program covers flying techniques and interpersonal skills. Teenagers who participate in the program feel empowered and excited about their future careers.

## Project Brief

The purpose of this software project is to develop a mobile application that replaces the need for a separate remote controller, enabling users to control drones using their smartphones or tablets. The project aims to revolutionize the way drones are controlled, making them more accessible, affordable, and user-friendly.

## Functional Requirements

- Arming Procedure: Prior to flying the plane, the user must complete a pre-flight arming procedure to check that all control surfaces and systems are operational.
- Throttle Control: Similar to a gas pedal in an automobile, the user can regulate the engine's power output by moving the left hand up and down. The throttle control has a % range that allows for incremental increases or decreases in power output.
- Rudder Control: A separate control input is provided by the plane's control system for directing the aircraft. The rudder can be adjusted by moving the left hand right or left. The rudder control controls the aircraft's vertical axis direction.
- Elevator/Pitch regulate: The right hand is used to regulate the airplane's pitch (nose up or down). The elevator/pitch control is adjusted by moving the right hand up or down, allowing for gradual changes within a % range.
- Aileron Control: A control input in the plane's control system is used to modify the aircraft's roll. The ailerons can be moved right or left using the user's right hand. This control affects the aircraft's roll or tilt.
- Independent Control: The throttle, rudder, elevator/pitch, and aileron controls operate independently of one another, allowing the user to fine-tune power, direction, angle, and roll.
- Measurement in Percentages: The throttle, rudder, elevator/pitch, and aileron controls are all stated in percentages. This enables the user to make exact modifications within a set range, with a percentage increase or reduction matching to a specific change in the flight parameter.
- Real-time Video Streaming: In addition to capturing live footage, we'll incorporate a function that lets users stream the drone's video feed directly to the user's mobile device. They will be able to track their flights in real-time and share their trips with others thanks to this fascinating immersive experience. Ensure smooth and high-quality video transmission, allowing users to monitor the drone's surroundings in real-time.
- Emergency response: in times of need. In order to make recovery easier in the event of loss or malfunction, we'll include a distress signal button that, when touched, will immediately start a return-to-home procedure or send out a locating beacon. Both users and program administrators will benefit from an extra layer of security and comfort from this feature.
- User Interface and Experience (UI/UX): Focus on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate and control the drone. Ensure that the app provides clear instructions and feedback to enhance the user experience.
- Drone Control and Safety: Implement precise and responsive controls for flying the drone, including features like takeoff, landing, altitude control, and maneuvering. Emphasize safety features such as geofencing to prevent drones from flying into restricted areas or collision avoidance technology to avoid obstacles. Ensure mobile app safety of drone operations and prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the app's features.
- User Registration: Allow users to establish accounts and log in to access the app's features and functionalities.
- Drone Connection: Allow for the establishment of a link between the mobile app and the drone in order to control its motions and activities.
- Drone Status Monitoring: Displays real-time information about the state of the drone, such as battery level, altitude, speed, and GPS coordinates.
- Camera Control: Allows users to control the drone's camera, including adjusting tilt, pan, zoom, and capturing photos or recording videos.


**SERVANT AS LEADER**

Listening and Empathy: As a servant leader within the drone mobile controller app development group, an individual should actively listen to team members', stakeholders', and end-users' wants and concerns. They can grasp the concerns and goals of others and include their input and viewpoints into the growth process by displaying empathy.  

Collaboration and teamwork: Servant leadership in the app development group entails cultivating a collaborative and welcoming team atmosphere. The servant leader would inspire team members to communicate openly, trust, and cooperate. They would provide opportunity for everyone to contribute their unique skills and ideas, while also valuing varied viewpoints and encouraging a sense of shared ownership and accomplishment.  

Servant Leadership in Action: As a servant leader, someone who works with the drone mobile controller app development group would actively participate in the development process. They would set a good example by accepting accountability for their actions and decisions. They would help team members, assist in overcoming obstacles, and guarantee that the project moves forward smoothly and effectively. 

Personal Development: A servant leader understands the value of personal development to better serve others. They would look for opportunities to improve their technical skills, drone industry knowledge, and leadership talents. They would become more productive in servicing the team and providing a high-quality app if they constantly improved themselves.
